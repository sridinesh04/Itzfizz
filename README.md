Pha5e Hero Section Clone This repository showcases a clone of the hero section from the reference website Pha5e, with smooth animations, hover effects, and dynamic mouse interactions.
The design is responsive and interactive, featuring the following functionalities:

Features:
Initial Animation:

Smoothly animate the appearance of text and images as the page loads using GSAP.
Text fades in and moves slightly upward, while the images appear sequentially.
Hover Interaction:

Hovering over an image causes it to become fully visible, while the other images transform into vector-like graphics with reduced opacity and scale.
Text changes its style (color and scale) on hover for an engaging effect.
Mouse Movement Effect:

The hovered image subtly follows the mouse within its container, creating a dynamic and interactive feel.
Responsive Design:

The hero section adapts to different screen sizes, adjusting the layout of the images and text accordingly for mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 for the structure of the page.
CSS3 for styling, including Flexbox for layout and GSAP for animations.
JavaScript (GSAP) for animating the elements and handling the hover and mouse movement interactions.
This project serves as a great demonstration of smooth animations and interactive UI elements using modern web technologies.
